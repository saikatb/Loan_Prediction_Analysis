# Loan_Prediction_Analysis

In this analysis, an attempt has been made to figure out the most important parameter which contributes positively to making a decision of giving out a loan or not. Needless to say, this is a problem of binary classification.

Below algorithms have been used while doing the analysis.

    1) Logistic Regression
    2) Support Vector Machine
    3) K Nearest Neighbour 
    4) Naive Bayes
    5) Random Forrest
  
The data of the data frames have been analyzed using python libraries i.e. pandas,numpy,matplotlib, seaborn and scikit learn.
